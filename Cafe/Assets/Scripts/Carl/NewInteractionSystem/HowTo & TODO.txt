Every interactable script inherits from NewAbstractInteractables.
The following is inherited directly:
    - NewItemType newItemType               >>> Set the item type of the object
    - bool isHoldAble                       >>> To be set on a prefab basis, to identify if the player can
                                            hold the object
    - bool isHeld                           >>> checks if the item is held or not
    - NewInteract playerInteractRef         >>> a reference to the interaction script that is on the player 
                                            object
    - Transform toolParent                  >>> a reference to the ToolParent object on the player
    
    - Hold function                         >>> Will let the player pick up the object
    - Drop function                         >>> Will let the player drop the object
    
The following are inherit abstract functions that need to be defined in each object:
    - Interact                              >>> Is called by the player's interact script on button press
    - Throw                                 >>> Throws the object
    - Serve                                 >>> Serves the object to a customer
    - WaterOperation                        >>> Performs operations related to the water (pond, pot)
    
Most functions in the new interactable script require that a reference to the player interaction script is
passed along.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NewInteract is the new interaction script that is placed on the player, this script can only interact with
the new NewAbstractInteractable class, meaning it will only interact with objects that are using the new
interaction system.

When the player press the "E" or "Space" key, the script will execute as follows:
1. If the player is not close to an interactable and not holding anything, nothing happens.
2. If the player is close to an interactable and nothing is being held, it will be picked up.
3. If the player is holding something, the held object's interact function will launch.

!!! Everytime the held object leaves the player's hands, it's important to run the "NoLongerHoldingSomething"
!!! function in the NewInteract script as this will clear the object reference.
